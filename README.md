# Zomato-Data-Analysis
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of Zomato restaurant data using Python. The primary objective of the project is to analyze customer behavior and restaurant performance to draw meaningful insights. The analysis is conducted using powerful Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data manipulation, visualization, and storytelling.

<h4>Project Objectives</h4>
The project aims to answer the following key questions:

Restaurant Type Preference: What type of restaurant do the majority of customers order from?
Votes by Restaurant Type: How many votes has each type of restaurant received from customers?
Restaurant Ratings: What are the ratings that the majority of restaurants have received?
Couplesâ€™ Average Spending: Zomato has observed that most couples order food online. What is their average spending on each order?
Mode with Maximum Rating: Which mode (online or offline) has received the maximum rating?
Offline Orders by Restaurant Type: Which type of restaurant receives more offline orders, so Zomato can incentivize customers with offers?
Tools and Libraries Used
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib: For basic visualizations.
Seaborn: For advanced statistical visualizations.
Plotly: For interactive and dynamic visualizations.
Workflow
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the Zomato dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gaining insights by answering the key questions mentioned above.
Visualization: Creating clear, insightful, and visually appealing plots to showcase findings.
Recommendations: Providing actionable insights based on the analysis.
